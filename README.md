# Roman-App
Roman is a real-time communication app with no authentication required. Join rooms with a code to chat secretly, and enjoy video and audio call functionality. Chat history is deleted when the room collapses, ensuring privacy. Rooms have a default duration of 30 minutes, which can be manually extended.
